# Installation

1. Download the latest SharePoint Framework packages **pnp-modern-search-core-spfx.sppkg** from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft-search/pnp-modern-search-core-components/releases).
2. Add **pnp-modern-search-core-spfx.sppkg** to the global tenant app catalog or a site collection app catalog. If you don't have an app catalog, follow this [procedure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/use-app-catalog) to create one.

    </div>

    > * The packages are deployed in the general Microsoft 365 CDN meaning **we don't host any code**.

    > * For the **pnp-modern-search-core-spfx.sppkg** package, you can choose to make the solution available in [all sites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/tenant-scoped-deployment) or force to install an app to the site every time.

    > * The solution asks the following API permissions by default to enhance the experience. These permissions are **not mandatory**. If you don't accept them, you will simply have less available features.

    > * You can approve scopes from the API Access screen in the SharePoint Admin Center: **https://&lt;tenant&gt;-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/online/AdminHome.aspx#/webApiPermissionManagement** If you'd like more details on this step, please see the [Approving Scopes](#approving-scopes) section below.

## Approving Scopes

You can approve the required scopes in the SharePoint Admin Center on the API Access page. When you visit that page, you will see any pending requests. The screenshot below shows the pending requests for the v4 solution.



You'll need to approve each request one at a time. If you have questions about what the requested scopes mean and what permissions they provide, check the article [Manage access to Azure AD-secured APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/api-access).

After you approve each request your view will be as shown in the screenshot below.
