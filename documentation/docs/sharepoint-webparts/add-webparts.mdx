# Add Web Parts to your site

Search Web Parts are deployed globally in the Ubisoft Microsoft 365 tenant. It means **you don't need to deploy them manually or request a deployment to your site**.

To add them on a SharePoint page, edit the page page and search for _"Ubisoft"_: 

<div className='center'> 
    ![Add WebParts](./img/add_webparts.png)
</div>

:::note
SharePoint Web Parts are meant for end-users to integrate them in their SharePoint pages.
