# Installation

1. Download the latest SharePoint Framework packages **pnp.webparts.search.core.sppkg** from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft-search/pnp-modern-search-core-components/releases).
2. Add **pnp.webparts.search.core.sppkg** to the global tenant app catalog or a site collection app catalog. If you don't have an app catalog, follow this [procedure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/use-app-catalog) to create one. 

    <div className='center'> 
        ![App Catalog](./img/app_catalog.png)
    </div>

    > * The packages are deployed in the general Microsoft 365 CDN meaning **we don't host any code**.

    > * For the **pnp.webparts.search.core.sppkg** package, you can choose to make the solution available in [all sites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/tenant-scoped-deployment) or force to install an app to the site every time.

    > * The solution asks the following API permissions by default to enhance the experience. These permissions are **not mandatory**. If you don't accept them, you will simply have less available features.

    > * You can approve scopes from the API Access screen in the SharePoint Admin Center: **https://&lt;tenant&gt;-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/online/AdminHome.aspx#/webApiPermissionManagement** If you'd like more details on this step, please see the [Approving Scopes](#approving-scopes) section below.
