# Introduction


PnP Modern Search Core Components are components you can reuse in your applications/projects to leverage information indexed in the Microsoft search engine inside your organization. We provide reusable components that can be used either in custom made applications through [**web components**](./web-components/available-components) or as [**SharePoint Web Parts**](./sharepoint-webparts/add-webparts) to be added to your sites.

:::info
These components are base on regular [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) built on top of [Microsoft Graph Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/overview), [FAST Components](https://www.fast.design/) and [Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/).
