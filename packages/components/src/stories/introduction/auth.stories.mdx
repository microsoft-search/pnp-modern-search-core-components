# Authentication

To get it work, some components need the current user to be logged in against Azure AD and the Microsoft 365 tenant where you try get data from.
The PnP Modern Search core components bundle include the Microsoft Graph Toolkit library `4.0.0` so it means you can use any components from it, like [authentication providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/providers/providers). 
Example:

```html
<mgt-file>
```
Provider component needs to be added to your page so other components that require authentication can work. Here is an example with the MSAL2 provider:

Example:

```html
<mgt-msal2-provider 
    client-id="<your_client_id>"
    authority="https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your_tenant_id>"
>
</mgt-msal2-provider>
```

Remember you have to configure API permissions on your Azure AD application depending the [entity types you use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/search-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0#scope-search-based-on-entity-types). For example:
- `Acronym.Read.All`
- `Bookmark.Read.All`
- `ExternalItem.Read.All`
- `Files.Read.All`
- `People.Read.All`
- `QnA.Read.All`
- `Site.Read.All`
- `User.Read`
